Dear Mentors，

We are UCD students currently working on the project Deep Metrics for Visual Retrieval Tasks. After reading some background 
papers and  some extra resources we come up with several ideas about the project, but we need to know which one is correct 
and we need your suggestions on the project so we can keep going. In that way, could you please inform us when are you 
available in this week so that the whole group can meet with you and solve our questions. We really appreciate your help!

Kind Regards,
Stay Safe Team

3. 2020.06.03: Contact Paul For Sever Application
Dear Paul,

We are master students in School of Computer Science currently working on our Degree Project. We know about we may need to contact you for the server application from our supervisor Simon. Our project is about Deep Metric Learning and may require a server to compete a series of Data Analysis targets. Could you please help us with the sever application please, we really appreciate your help.

Kind Regards，
Zhao

4. 2020.06.03: Contact Simon For Help Contacting Mentors 
Dear Simon,

This is group Stay Safe currently working on Deep Metrics for Visual Retrieval Tasks.

We have contacted Microsoft mentors but there is still no reply from them, and we really really need their help to gain a better understanding of the project. Currently we have no information from them, the whole group is worried about this since we know nothing about their attitude towards the project. And currently we are working on a demo about Deep Metrics Learning since this should be necessary for the whole project.

Could you please help us contact them? A lot of questions need clarifications from them. And we really appreciate your help.

Kind Regards,
Stay Safe Team

9. 2020.06.15: Send Questions for Meeting
Dear mentors,

During our weekend work, we came up with two new questions. 

1. When deploying the neural network to map images to embeddings, we found that we didn't have permission to use Azure Notebook. We think it will be more convenient to use this.

2. Do you think it is feasible for us to apply a certain number of models to retrieval system when we have implemented them? 
	a). For example, if we have trained six models and whenever the retrieval system receives new query instructions, the six models process the image in parallel and finally return the results of the model with the best performance.
	b). Or should we analyze and evaluate these models and then choose a single model to build the retrieval system?

Thanks a lot,
Stay Safe Team
