Meeting tool: Zoom
Duration: About 45 minutes

Important points:
1. Overall evaluation of Project Plan:
	Quite ambitious and need to make sure this plan is feasible and down to earth.
2. Suggestions:
	-Consider whether the number of models to be implemented is overloaded for all members. If all models cannot be implemented before week 7, then complete 6 to 8 models first and use week 7 as a buffer to continue this work.
	-Develop and show a demo website in Interim presentation, not just data.
	-Begin to build a website early and finish coding part at the end of week 9 to make sure User Evaluations run well in week 10.
	-Try to make it clear that in what condition (same optimizer or same hyperparameter) all members are going to compare the 12 models and what evaluate metrics will be used.
	(Precision@1, MAP@R, and R-precision are used to evaluate metrics but the condition used for every model is not ensured yet.)
3. Grade schema
	Focus more on how well these models are compared and analyzed.
4. Questions about the 8 minimum requirements (Still waiting for replies*****)
	-Website usable on multiple device types: 
		Not a very big problem, just need to be confirmed.
	-Non-arbitrary use of at least 2 web APIs: 
		It is hard to add Web APIs into this research project.
	-The back-end must use auto-scaling: 
  		Is it necessary in a research project since our back-end is very simple?
 	-At least 2 diﬀerent user contexts / stories
  		Is it a hard requirement because user context in this project is also very simple?

Task to be done: 
	All members discuss and adjust the original plan a little and talk to Microsoft mentors and teachers again

=========================================================
	June 16th (Monday)-FEEDBACK SESSION
=========================================================
(With Neil Hurley and Hamidreza Khalaghzadeh)
Note taker: Hanyuxi Zhou/Ning Tao
Meeting tool: Zoom
Duration: About 45 minutes

Important points:
1. An introduction to our project: 
	-Objectives:
		(1)Implement and compare 6-12 metric learning models and propose a new model with better performance
		(2)Develop a website showing our research results and retrieving pictures using our models
	-Progresses:
		(1)Read basic papers about metric learning and some more about contrastive loss
		(2)Developed HTML pages for front-end, deployed cloud environment for back-end and implemented a model using contrastive loss as its loss function.
2. Details about contrastive loss model:
	-An artificial neural network which uses contrastive loss as a loss function, turning pixels of images into two-dimensional vectors used for visualization.
	-Contain two main parts:
		(1)Embedding function: turn input pictures into vectors in embedding space, which can be visualized in a two-dimensional coordinate system.
		(2)Similarity function: calculate distance between vectors in embedding space
	-Return the top k most similar pictures
	-Use precision as evaluations of different models for images are labeled in our dataset.
3. Suggestions:
	-Building a simple and straightforward application is good for fitting into the grade schema
	-Make sure some members are working on embedding methods
	-Embedding space pictures can be added to the query results showing in the website
	-Random similarity can be assigned to images in the dataset just to help to develop the prototype.
4. Q&A:
(1)Would implementing ensemble models be a good idea?
	Yes, on top of understanding ensemble and models deeply, it would be good to do some more exciting things. And making some really good combination on several models would be better than putting a lot of hard work on so many models. 
	After finishing the prototype well, some members who are especially interested in some similar models can try to do this combination. Be careful about your time scale.
(2)Does the parallel question mean something related to ensemble?
	No, it is beyond ensemble method. If some model takes too much time to run then you can try to make it run in a parallel way. Ensemble would be a simpler way but you may come up with some really good algorithm that nobody has done.
	Doing a new embedding method mathematically would be fantastic but that's quite challenging. You should be careful about the time scale so that you won't get into a situation where nothing is achieved. Maybe one of the members can take this risky task and other members make sure those not risky tasks are finished.



=========================================================
	June 16th (Monday)-GROUP MEETING
=========================================================
Noter taker: Hanyuxi Zhou

2. Azure Notebook access (Yikai Wang):
	UCD Email address do not have the permission to use Azure Notebook so may be try to set up a VM and install Jupyter Notebook. Remote development can be a good choice.




=========================================================
	June 18th (Thursday)-GROUP MEETING
=========================================================
Note taker: Hanyuxi
Meeting tool: Microsoft Teams
Duration: About 45 minutes

Important points:
1. Model structure:
	-Five layer-structure / Twin network
	-Each element in the dataset (in the final layer) is made up of two 28*28 images (two tensors) and a Boolean flag showing whether the images belong to the same class
	-Data preprocessing: Turn pictures into gray-scale, resize them into 28*28 pixels, store them into tensors, normalize them and put them into dataset finally
	-Dataset is in a self-structure
2. Web application processing:
	-Web browser sends HTTP request which contains an image URL to web server, and the relevant functions in web server deals with this request, downloading the image. 
	-Then this image is sent to our model as a parameter and our model returns a list of model indexes. 
	-Finally, image paths with these indexes are selected from database and after obtaining these images, web server send a list of these images as a response to web browser.
3. Database structure:
	-Images are stored in server disks and image paths as well as indexes are stored in database.
4. Project directory:
	-Python files
	-WSGI setting files
	-Directory 'templates' (HTML files)
	-Directory 'static' (CSS/JS/IMG files)
	
Task to be done (in this week):
	Yikai Wang/Yili Lai: Make front-end static files (CSS, JS and so on) available and deal with HTTP request
	Hanyuxi Zhou/Yuping Tian: Database access

		(4)Key technical problem to be solved or what to be achieved
	-Make people interested in it and fund it in first several minutes
	-More professional graphs
	-Practice the cooperation of the members in the presentation
2. Evaluation plan (in the coming 2 weeks)
	-Software system performance: 
		(1)Response speed: 
			Write python script to send requests and count the respond time
		(2)Multiple requests processing
	-Model evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall and speed of models
	-Retrieval quality: 
		(1)Verify models performance using validate pictures set with different backgrounds or object status.
		(2)Collect users' opinion on performance of models using surveys
	-The plan will be executed from next Thursday after finishing implementing our models.
	-Feedback of evaluation
		(1)When applying model to large dataset, response speed won't be high since tens of thousands of distance calculation are needed.
		(2)Evaluation plan makes sense based on the user stories provided.
3. Q&A:
	(1) Since our project and website are for researching and learning, and the target users are someone like machine learning developers, how can we make adjustments so that people with business purpose would like to fund our website?
	Answer: The topic and area of this kind of research are much more beyond this project. You don't need to show that your project solves everything, but need to show them the potential of continuous work and research and persuade them that this kind of research is profitable. For example, the continuous research might be video retrieval and this research could be used in other applications.

=========================================================
	July 21st (Tuesday)-FEEDBACK SESSION
=========================================================
(With Neil Hurley and Hung Ngo)
Note taker: Hanyuxi Zhou
Meeting tool: Zoom
Duration: Around 25 minutes

1. Evaluation plan:
	(1) Deploy multiple models and collect users' opinion on retrieval results
	(2) Users' interaction with the system needed
	(3) Different images for all users in evaluation as input and the user evaluation of outputs should say something to improve our models.
	(4) Current user interface:
		-Users upload a picture as a query.
		-The picture is turned into a tensor and our model puts the tensor into the embedding space created ahead of time and retrieves the top 10 closest tensors of pictures.
		-Web server returns and shows the 10 pictures to users.
2. Progress of our team:
	(1) 7 models have been finished.
	(2) Most of the models can achieve an accuracy of around 75%. Some of the models are kind of similar while others are not.
3. Suggestion:
	(1) Consider more about the details of different performances of models and the reasons for that.
	(2) Design and modify a pilot study with 2 members from other groups before the real evaluation and the final user study will be between 6 students. Think careful about questions to be put in the survey, aspects of systems to be learning and the effect.
4. Q&A:
(1) We finished 7 models with prototypes provided but the other 5 models have only descriptions and are much harder to be implemented.
Focus more on the deliverables and pay attention to covering the grade evaluation points. Seven models, a really good user survey, a good user interface and a good report will give a good grade as long as you have put enough effort into implementation and understanding of the models.

	August 12th Feedback session
=========================================================
(With Simon and Chidubem)
Note taker: Ning Tao
Meeting tool: Zoom
Duration: About 35 minutes

-Discussion:
(1) Q(Simon): It is Very demonstrated the part of retrieve image for normal user; however, it is not very clear about the use case for researcher for comparing models. How does the web application do the comparison work?
	A(Yikai): Use different indicator (precision and recall) for getting evaluation numeric result and show as graph on the web application.
(2) Q(Simon): How if a user wants to compare his own model with existing model on the web application?
	A(Yikai): We have a complete pipeline for testing and comparing models, user can download the code from GitHub and follow the instruction to compare the provided model with existing ones. (PS: this could be added in the future work)
(3) Q(Simon): Why you chose these seven models for the web application?
 	A(Zhao): We selected these models following the instruction of the Microsoft mentors. Considering the time limit and implementation difficulties, we implemented seven models that have code provided with the paper. (PS: In the report, present this part better, instead of we implement the model due to the implementation convenience, we rather to say the property of the model)
(4) Q(Simon): In the web comparison page, there is a bar graph and what is the blue bar that labelled metric means?
	A (Ning Tao): The metric stands for the numeric evaluation result that gained from indicators, in detail, it shows the normalized result of the precision@1 result among the whole dataset. 
(5) Q(Simon): Extra discussion about which metric is the best is missing, this should be included in the report.
	A (Yili): This is discussed in the demo at the algorithm introduction part. (it should be explanation more about result of the comparison, such as this is what we found out from the project)
(6) Q (Simon): what does the K mean in the retrieve code? Is that mean higher K value cost greater computation cost?
	A (Hanyuxi Zhou): Yes. (Ton: Actually, it is not correct, the retrieve code can return the k nearest images in less than 4 seconds no matter how large the k value is. This is due to the distance between query image and whole dataset is already calculated and included in that 4 second)
(7) Q (Simon): Did you use any web API for the project?
	A(Ton): Due to our dataset for the project is directly provided and we don’t need web API to collect data dynamically. But we used multiple toolkit for the web application development, including bootstrap, Vega etc.
(8) Q (Simon): Scalability discussion.
	A(Yikai): We have highly extendable pipeline, which means we can add more model and dataset easily.
(9) Q (Yili): Report page limit discussion.
	A(Simon): Follow the template and everything is fine.
